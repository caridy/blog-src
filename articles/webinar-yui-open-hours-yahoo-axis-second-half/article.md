<p>These are some of the bullets we covered during the second half:</p>
<h3>Mojito (on Axis)</h3>
<ul>
<li>(caridy) mojito apps can be fully configured by the time your application logic executes; no logic branching within your app based on things like device, only configurations</li>
<li>(caridy) mojito context</li>
<li>(caridy) mojito YCB (show example of *.json)</li>
<li>(caridy) mojito dimensions</li>
<li>(caridy) mojito tunnel (executing an action, how it preserve the context)</li>
<li>(caridy) YUI Integration – Dependencies resolution (mention shaker and screwdriver)</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s about it!</p>
